    "description": "mensaDD is an Android app for retrieving the menus of student canteens in and around Dresden. The main reason for this project was my personal dissatisfaction with available canteen apps. Besides displaying the menu plans, mensaDD supports the visualisation of all canteens on a map as well as checking the current credit balance of the canteen card. Vegeterian meals can optionally be highlighted. In addition to the app itself, the project includes a server-side crawler that regularly retrieves the offers from the Studentenwerk's website.",
